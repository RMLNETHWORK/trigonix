  <h1>🧠 Top 5 Trigonometric Identities You Must Know</h1>
  
  <div class="blog-post">
    <p>Trigonometric identities are equations involving trigonometric functions that are true for all valid input values. Mastering these identities is crucial for simplifying expressions, solving equations, and proving mathematical statements. Here are the five most essential identities every student should know.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Pythagorean Identities</h3>
    <p>The fundamental Pythagorean identities derive from the Pythagorean theorem and the unit circle:</p>
    <div class="formula">
      <p>sin²θ + cos²θ = 1</p>
      <p>1 + tan²θ = sec²θ</p>
      <p>1 + cot²θ = csc²θ</p>
    </div>
    <p>These identities are invaluable for converting between trigonometric functions and simplifying complex expressions.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Angle Sum and Difference Identities</h3>
    <p>These identities express trigonometric functions of sums or differences of angles in terms of functions of the angles themselves:</p>
    <div class="formula">
      <p>sin(A ± B) = sinAcosB ± cosAsinB</p>
      <p>cos(A ± B) = cosAcosB ∓ sinAsinB</p>
      <p>tan(A ± B) = (tanA ± tanB)/(1 ∓ tanAtanB)</p>
    </div>
    <p>They're essential for solving problems involving compound angles and Fourier analysis.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Double Angle Identities</h3>
    <p>Special cases of the sum identities where both angles are equal:</p>
    <div class="formula">
      <p>sin(2θ) = 2sinθcosθ</p>
      <p>cos(2θ) = cos²θ - sin²θ = 2cos²θ - 1 = 1 - 2sin²θ</p>
      <p>tan(2θ) = 2tanθ/(1 - tan²θ)</p>
    </div>
    <p>These are particularly useful in calculus when integrating trigonometric functions.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Half-Angle Identities</h3>
    <p>Derived from the double-angle identities, these allow expression of functions at half angles:</p>
    <div class="formula">
      <p>sin(θ/2) = ±√[(1 - cosθ)/2]</p>
      <p>cos(θ/2) = ±√[(1 + cosθ)/2]</p>
      <p>tan(θ/2) = ±√[(1 - cosθ)/(1 + cosθ)] = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = sinθ/(1 + cosθ)</p>
    </div>
    <p>These identities are crucial for solving certain integrals and in harmonic analysis.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Product-to-Sum and Sum-to-Product Identities</h3>
    <p>These convert between products and sums of trigonometric functions:</p>
    <div class="formula">
      <p>sinAcosB = ½[sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)]</p>
      <p>cosAcosB = ½[cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)]</p>
      <p>sinA + sinB = 2sin[(A+B)/2]cos[(A-B)/2]</p>
      <p>cosA + cosB = 2cos[(A+B)/2]cos[(A-B)/2]</p>
    </div>
    <p>These are particularly useful in wave physics and electrical engineering applications.</p>
    
    <div class="example-box">
      <h4>Application Example</h4>
      <p>Simplify the expression: sin(15°)cos(15°)</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Using the product-to-sum identity:</p>
      <p>sinAcosB = ½[sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)]</p>
      <p>Let A = B = 15°</p>
      <p>sin(15°)cos(15°) = ½[sin(30°) + sin(0°)] = ½[½ + 0] = ¼</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Memorization Techniques</h3>
    <p>To remember these identities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand their geometric derivations from the unit circle</li>
      <li>Practice deriving them from Euler's formula</li>
      <li>Create flashcards with the identities on one side and examples on the other</li>
      <li>Use them regularly in problem-solving to reinforce memory</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Mastering these five categories of identities will give you the tools to tackle nearly any trigonometric problem you encounter in mathematics, physics, or engineering courses.</p>
